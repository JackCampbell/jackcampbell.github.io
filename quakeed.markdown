# QuakeEd (wxWidgets)


I developed an application to maintain the compatibility of the QuakeEd editor used for Quake and Quake 2 games on new platforms. This project will serve as an important tool for modifying classic games and creating new content. By adapting the core features of QuakeEd, such as map editing, texture manipulation, and placing in-game objects, to modern technologies, I aim to reach a broader audience of players and developers.

The application I developed is designed to work seamlessly across a wide range of platforms, from mobile devices to desktop computers, with a user-friendly interface. I plan to facilitate the creative process for users while regularly incorporating community feedback for updates and new features.

With this innovative project, I hope to create an exciting opportunity to rediscover the legendary worlds of Quake and Quake 2 and introduce them to a new generation of players.
