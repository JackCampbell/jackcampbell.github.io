# Vortex Engine

In 2012, I developed the ARB plugin available in the OpenGL library individually, and the Vortex Engine game engine to exemplify dynamic interactive shading. Interactive shading of the surfaces interacting with light on the specified map has been made. I added animation, particle detailing and light shadow volume in the game engine. With this engine I developed, __Hasan Kalyoncu University__ (former name: __Gazikent University__) became my internship application project.

It is designed as an advanced graphics engine.

* Dynamic per-pixel lighting (ARB)
* Shadow Volume
* Interactive texture shadows (Forward Shading/Deferred Shading)
* Animation
* Material, Model, Sound ve Particle Effect
* User interactive graphical interface (GUI)
* Simple physics engine
* Virtual Texture and LOD system on surfaces with high texture
* Map editor and BSP(Binary Space Partition) compiler
* Platform support (Win32, SDL2, GLFW)
* GPU Driver (OpenGL / GLES / DirectX)
* Physical acceleration with SSE instruction set

This engine is designed as a virtual reality and simulation usage area.
