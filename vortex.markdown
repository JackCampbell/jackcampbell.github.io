# Vortex Engine

In 2011, I developed an innovative game engine named Vortex Engine for my internship program. This engine allows for real-time shading of surfaces based on light interactions within a specified environment, providing players with a more immersive and impactful experience. The system I developed utilizes dynamic lighting and real-time shading techniques to enhance the depth and realism of the scenes.

Within Vortex Engine, I integrated various features such as animation, particle effects, and light shadow volumes to enrich the visual experience. The animation system ensures smooth movement of characters and environments, while the particle effects enable realistic displays of explosions, smoke, and other visual phenomena. The light shadow volumes add a sense of depth and volume to the scenes, further enhancing the atmosphere.

This project not only helped me improve my technical skills but also served as a foundational work for my internship application. Through Vortex Engine, I gained significant experience in both software development and graphic design, making it a pivotal step in my career.
