Together with [Dr. Ünal Hayta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Uenal-Hayta), we developed advanced software that controls VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) and Mini UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) during flight, utilizing sophisticated image processing techniques and a logical decision-making mechanism to effectively complete tasks. This innovative system enables the UAV to autonomously perform designated missions while enhancing its ability to adapt to environmental conditions by processing real-time data. The developed UAV participated in the 2022 Teknofest event, showcasing its capabilities and highlighting its potential in this field.
