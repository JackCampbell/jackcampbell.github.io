It visualizes data in three dimensions, presenting it in Axial, Coronal, and Sagital sections, allowing users to perform in-depth analysis. The sections can move along their axes, enabling more detailed examination. Additionally, various imaging options such as MIP, ATER (vessel), bone, and skin modes assist in clearly evaluating different tissues and structures. The ability to make measurements on the sections enhances the practicality of the application, allowing users to analyze medical data more effectively. Medica aims to provide significant advantages to healthcare professionals in diagnostic processes and patient management.
