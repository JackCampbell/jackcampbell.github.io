# EEG Monitor

Together with [Prof. Dr. İbrahim Erkutlu](http://ibrahimerkutlu.com/Default.aspx), I conducted in-depth studies in the field of medical signal processing, specifically focusing on transport and EEG monitoring. During this process, the signals obtained during monitoring were filtered using specific frequency ranges. The developed system not only enables the precise and reliable analysis of EEG data but also supports common standards such as EDF, EDF+, BDF, and BDF+ formats, providing flexibility for integration into various application areas. With this project, we made significant contributions to the improvement of medical data analysis and monitoring processes.
